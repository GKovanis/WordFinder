# WordFinder

Exercise 2 of the "Programming Techniques" course at School of ECE NTUA.

In the exercise we were requested to created a word indexing for texts. Specifically, we would be a given a text as an input and we had to determine the position that this word appears in (e.g. (2,7) marks that the first character of a word appears in the **2nd row** and **7th column**.

Program will store and search the positions based on a _Hash Table_ and will use _Binary Search Trees_ to resolve any conflicts.
